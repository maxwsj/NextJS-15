I'll start learning very basics NextJS concepts, and then I'll dive into all the core features that make up NextJS. Both in theory as well as with multiple real projects where all concepts will be applied step-by-step.

In detail, this course will cover:
- What is NextJS? And why would you I it?
- Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?
- Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects
- Working with file-based routing
- Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes
- Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering
- Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps
- Handling form submissions with Server Actions
- Handling File upload
- Pre-generating dynamic and static pages
- Adding optimizations like metadata to pages
- Optimizing images with the NextJS Image component
- Building fullstack apps with API routes or Server Actions
- Managing app-wide state with React context (in NextJS apps)
- Adding authentication to NextJS apps
- Multiple complete apps where I'll apply all these core concepts!
- A complete React.js refresher module
- A NextJS summary module so that I can refresh what I learned or just explore the core features quickly


What Iâ€™ll learn:
- Learn how to build fullstack React apps with NextJS 15 & the App Router
- Build real projects and apply what you learned with hands-on projects and examples
- Learn about different ways of building NextJS app - App Router vs Pages Router
- Get started with React Server Components, Client Components, data fetching & more!
- Handle data submissions via Server Actions
- Learn all key NextJS features like pre-rendering, SSR, data fetching, file-based routing and authentication
- Take the full course or the "NextJS Summary" module for a quickstart if you have limited time
